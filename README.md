# dark-map

## Design Ideas

~~* lava under floors, and in walls~~
* have light sources high up above a layer of ctf_map:ignore to make them inaccessible; useful for navigation
* no landmines
* two floors, with one flag on the top and one on the bottom 
* mese blocks that can be lights, or broken for weapons/tools
* each level is a square hall with rooms on both sides
* Top floor is a rotated copy of the bottom floor
* two stairways in the middle

## Notes

The glass walls are just for visibility while building, they should be replaced later.

The map might be too wide.
